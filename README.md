Review:
A found that watching this course at 75% was the only way to understand the material. The tutorial is not for beginners. And even after watching the tutorial I had to review the solution files several times before understanding how things were working.

I would highly recommend taking the effort to go through this tutorial and trying to code the app from first watching the video alone and then going back and reviewing the solutions that weren't explained in the video. I initially came up with a solution that worked but was clumsy. This clumsy solution did allow me to understand scopes better. The instructor solutions showed me the Angular way to structure this app.
